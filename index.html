        <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo</h1>
        <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is a part of Real Madrid's legacy and will forever be remember as one of the great icons
            throughout the club's history. He was unveiled at the Santiago Bernabéu on 6 July 2009, where he was joined
            by Eusebio and Alfredo Di Stéfano, and since that day, the goals just kept coming. He netted 451 times in
            438 competitive appearances with Real Madrid (averaging over a goal a game). He registered in all of the
            competitions he featured in: 312 in LaLiga, 105 in the Champions League, 22 in the Copa del Rey, six in the
            Club World Cup, four in the Spanish Super Cup and two in the UEFA Super Cup. Nobody throughout the club's
            history has scored as many goals as the Portuguese attacker, who boasts an impressive trophy haul as a Real
            Madrid player: four Champions League crowns, three Club World Cups and UEFA Super Cups apiece, two LaLiga
            titles, a pair of Copas del Rey and two Spanish Super Cups. This list of honours is completed with four
            Ballons d'Or, three Golden Shoe awards, two The Best awards, whilst he was named UEFA Best Player in Europe
            three times and landed the Pichichi crown on three occasions.</p>
